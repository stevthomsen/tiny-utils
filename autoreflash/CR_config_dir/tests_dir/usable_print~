#	reflash [repo] [target] [build_tag] => First the config_dir/$proj/ directory will be checked for a .fhx files.
#			If none are found then we will query bkdb for the latest untested build for this project.
#			You may specify the repository the build must come from, or the specific build_tag that
#			you would like to download.
#		eg. reflash sr1_merge.bk flash
#
#	prompt [message] => The user will be prompted with 'Continue' or 'Exit', and the appriopate action will be taken.
#		eg. prompt I have finished printing the photo. Should I continue?
#
#	report => If you have downloaded a fhx and requested a test from bkdb, this command will mark the testing as 
#		finished and open a webbrowser for you to fill details about the completed test.
